========================================================================

(*dirty version*)

**Probably discontinued**

Principal structure
-------------------

Modelling process is controlled by the instance of a base `Model` class and includes:

	* a list of **Events** applied time-to-time to the state of the model. 
	* a list of **Objects**; each object characterized by its own set of parameters, changing in time 
	  by applying **Actions**; 
	* a list of **Actions**; they are heart of the model and could change everything in it;

Key features
------------

	* Ease co-working process on model creation;
	* Monte-Carlo experiments on models;
	* Ease comparison of several models;
	* Lots of predefined **Actions**, **Grids** etc.
